Learn and Be curious 

Always would like to push myself to uncomfortable situation . Learning is very important for me . I will ensure I will keep learning . 
Working dynamic environemt ranging from younger kids new out of school to VP for different projects. Got to be innovative when you have clients ranging from VP , president to 
new younger kids from school , learning new things and being updated is very important be it technical or powepoint session or new concepts  .
Action :  Achieve by attending brown bag session / learning sessions 
Situation :No reason to learn python was curious to learn about Python while it was still in nascent stage , After 3 years i have to work on python API , 
it came handy . 
All hands. We used to discuss , focus on learning was not has strog .


=============================================================================================================================================


Hire and develop the best :
I am in consulating organization . Long term developing a team member is never an opportunity because always the rotation of team members .Whatever time was there always developed the skills 
or identify the skills that is important to complete the project.
Hiring : Being consulting I have to do Internal networking , One of the metric which I will be evaluated is KRA ( Key result area) 
external recruiting . I do lunch and learn , yI have to network internal / know what projects 
Hiring is internal and external : Asset is your team , KRA : Key reulst area, one of my KRA is utilization , I make it a point who can be stffed into my project , which project I can be staffed into .

Results:
comments , uploading latest codes to github , no story in the deck , one point spread across multiple ppt .

===============================================================================================================================================

Think big :

Next opinion leader : Start engaging with the physicians . 
Think big : Try to think of dart shelf optimization tool. In shelf optimization 100% art , no science , provide mathematical and how they can use it . 
Did not trust search algorithm , using long historical data .Hence that algorithkm was not being used .
100 % confident , I will be able to 
In cosnulting , always start with current situation and expected .
 Always strive towards the expected situation ,how to add values to the customers at each step while the journey is achieving towards the final goals 
 work towards what is next , develop next road map and present new ideas to the stakeholders. This breeds inquisitiveness in the customers is appreciated.
 Even If I dont win , i dont want to be not nimble , I want to continue and keep thinking big 

=================================================================================================================================================
Bias for Action: Speed matters , many decisions and actions are reversible 
Specialized dart , make assumptions, assume data and move forward .Could be that data is sufficient , also discovery phase of the business , could be 
===============================================================================================================================================
Frugality :
 In consulting business engagemnets are usually to solve the problems that has never been solved or the team does not have prior experience in solving the problems.

  Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit
 ===================================================================
 From the project : Multiple situation where we need to disagree from the original analysis , not on what is happening currently in the business but rather 
 Customer behavior keeps changing , difficult to do forecasting. Disagree from the orignal analysis and commit to the new analysis .
 Also , these are varied with respect to changes in the original scope of the project.

Email marketing identify customers who have the propensity to buy items in 30 - 60 days and also identify items recommend to customers . 
No models was used to recommend items for new users items were recommended based on look alike models based on category . models was based on 30-60- 90 days . 
Challenges : SAS not installed in same environment as with the data . So as to move the data from one system to the other. While the model takes only few hrs to run . The whole processof 
of moving the data took close to 4 days . Models were not created at sub category at sub category . 

Customer cohort analyssis :
Objective of the analysis while the company usually forecast on the revenue. No models were developed to forecast for customers . Cohorts were developed to forecast on the retention and churn of the
